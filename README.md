<h1>RizzlerBot</h1>

A multi-functional discord bot I made using the Java JDA library.

Has a full functional music player that streams audio from a url or a search query to a voice channel. Also has a feature that gives you a raw video link to watch any movie/show you query though chat. You can also create a watch2gether room that links that queried show/movie so you can watch with others. 

Additional features:
-perform a google image search though the chat
-get a AI-generated art from the DALLE api based on a text prompt you query through chat.
